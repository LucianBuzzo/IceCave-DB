# IceCave DB

A super lightweight flat file storage system for nodejs.

IceCave is designed for use in applications where relatively small amounts of
data need to be permanently stored and a dedicated external database service is
impractical or overkill.
IceCave stores data in-memory and periodically dumps it's contents to
a JSON file. On startup it will read this file location and load any data found
there.

IceCave stores data in an array-like collection and its API methods reflect that.
IceCave intentionally offers a very limited set of methods and leaves it up to you,
the developer, to build integrations that suit your application.

# Usage

Below is a quick example how to use IceCave DB:

```js
const IceCave = require('icecave');

// Create a new storage instance that will be written to the directory './data-directory'
const storage = IceCave.create('./data-directory', 'storage');

// Add items to the database
storage.push({ id: 1, name: 'Adam' });
storage.push({ id: 2, name: 'Ben' });
storage.push({ id: 3, name: 'Chris' });

// Find an item in the database
const user = storage.find(item => item.id === 2); // --> { id: 2, name: 'Ben' }
```
